# Data Quest-Predicting-the-criticality-of-the-accident-in-dehradun-region.
The data is based on the road accidents in Dehradun District of Uttarakhand State.
# Points to be noted:
As there are very less Non-critical accidents in the dataset it is highly inbalanced.
Feature engineering is done and relevant features are selected for further analysis.
Xgb algorithm is used for predicting the model and AUC-ROC Score is used as our performance metric.
